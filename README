Regional Ocean Modeling System

This is a branch of the ROMS code kept at myroms.org
(https://www.myroms.org/), containing sea ice and several other
changes people have contributed, notably the CoSiNE ecosystem model
and some ice shelf fixes. You are strongly encouraged to register with

This specific fork (mack_local is the main branch) contains additions
to Kate's code, including modifications from my dissertation work,
and code originally written by Mike Dinniman.
